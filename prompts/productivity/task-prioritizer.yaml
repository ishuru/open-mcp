      URGENT & IMPORTANT (Do First):
      1. Respond to client email about contract renewal
         Reason: Time-sensitive, directly impacts revenue

      2. Prepare presentation for board meeting
         Reason: Deadline approaching, high-stakes audience

      IMPORTANT but NOT URGENT (Schedule):
      3. Update project roadmap
         Reason: Strategic planning, no immediate deadline

      4. Review team performance reports
         Reason: Important for team growth, can be scheduled

      URGENT but NOT IMPORTANT (Delegate):
      5. Schedule dentist appointment
         Reason: Urgent but administrative - can delegate to assistant

      NEITHER (Eliminate/Defer):
      6. Organize desktop files
         Reason: Low impact, defer to downtime

      7. Water the plants
         Reason: Low impact, can be automated or delegated
